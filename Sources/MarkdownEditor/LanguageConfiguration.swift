//
//  Language configurations determine the linguistic characteristics that are important for the editing and display of
//  code in the respective languages, such as comment syntax, bracketing syntax, and syntax highlighting
//  characteristics.
//
//  We adopt a two-stage approach to syntax highlighting. In the first stage, basic context-free syntactic constructs
//  are being highlighted. In the second stage, contextual highlighting is performed on top of the highlighting from
//  stage one. The second stage relies on information from a code analysis subsystem, such as SourceKit.
//
//  Curent support here is only for the first stage.
